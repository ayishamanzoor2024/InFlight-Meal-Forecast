# In-Flight Meal Forecast 
This is a Django-based web application that forecasts the number of in-flight meal orders using time series prediction models.

# Purpose
Built as part of an AI/ML assessment task to demonstrate time series forecasting in a real-world scenario.

# Project Overview
The application allows users to:
- Upload or use existing in-flight meal data.
- Input a desired number of future days to forecast.
- Generate a line plot showing predicted trends with confidence intervals.
- View total meal order trends over time.

The model used for forecasting is Facebook Prophet.
